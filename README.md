## üìà Insights

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ How can the platform leverage partnerships with telecom companies to expand its subscriber base?  
Offering **mobile data discounts** through telecom partnerships for OTT subscribers can attract more customers, leveraging the increasing trend of mobile device usage for content consumption.  
- **Why it works:** As mobile devices become the primary platform for content consumption, offering telecom customers mobile data discounts for accessing the merged OTT platform can boost user acquisition. This strategy appeals to a wide range of customers, especially in regions with data cost concerns, while encouraging higher engagement among users who prefer streaming on the go.  
- **Impact:** Such offers not only attract new subscribers but also retain existing users, positioning the platform as a **cost-effective choice for mobile streaming.**

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ How should the merged platform price its subscription plans to compete effectively while maintaining profitability?  

- **Launch a Free Ad-Supported Tier** to expand reach.  
- **Reduce the Basic Plan price to ‚Çπ59** (lower than both Lio and Jotstar) to drive higher adoption, especially among the large **18-24 student segment**, which can lead to higher future upgrades.  
- **Increase the Premium Plan price to ‚Çπ399** while offering **multi-device access** to ensure profitability and cater to family audiences who need multi-device usage.

**Key Observations:**  
- Most new subscribers start with a lower-tier plan (Free/Basic) before upgrading.  
- Users in lower-tier plans (Free & Basic) show **higher inactivity rates**.  
- **Recommendation:** Launching a **Free Ad-Supported Tier** not only increases reach but also generates **ad revenue**, ensuring that non-paying users contribute to profits.  
- **Targeting the 18-24 age group:** This segment has the highest number of subscribers but also the most **inactive users**. A **lower Basic Plan price at ‚Çπ59** can increase engagement and retention, and users are more likely to upgrade to **Premium/VIP** over time.  
- **Family Users:** Increasing the Premium Plan price to ‚Çπ399 with multi-device support enhances value perception, ensuring higher profitability while catering to **households that share accounts**.

- Behavior-triggered notifications  
- Special offers aimed at re-engaging them  
These AI-driven strategies help boost **retention** and enhance the overall user experience, keeping users connected to the platform.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ What strategies can the merged platform implement to increase engagement among inactive users and convert them into active users?  
**Inactivity trends:**  
- **Highest inactivity** is among users from **City Tier 3**, possibly due to connectivity issues or lack of relevant content.  
**Strategy:**  
- Improve the app for **low-bandwidth streaming** and offer **offline downloads** to users in **City Tier 3**, which could increase engagement.  
- Many users on the **Free** and **Basic plans** show inactivity over time. **Solution:** Allow Free users to **watch one Premium title per week** to spark interest in upgrades.
